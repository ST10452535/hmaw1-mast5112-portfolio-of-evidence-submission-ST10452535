## Warning!!

I TRIED TO RESOLVE THE ERROR ON THE APP, BUT UNFORTUNATLY I COULDN'T.
I coded my app, and it did run the first time and when I was busy trying to resolve a error, it seems something crashed my application, therefore I didn't get a chance to run my app.

Below is the proof of a continuas error 500, relating to the server.

## What I changed:

1. I improved the appearance of the application, by rounding sections that seemed fitting. Meaning I removed the two buttons next to the header and and increased the size of the image header.
2. I ensured that the average of the courses was being displayed (in green).
3. I proceeded to round the text input and, echanced the text input of courses for three radio buttons that represented the courses, that coloured darker when selected.
4. I made sure the menu items can be stored in an array, yet the chef will be able to remove and add items and choose which menu items can be displayed on the home screen and which not by using a switch.
5. A filter page was added and made to be able for according to search based on course and meal.
6. The appearance was rounded.
7. Lastly the overall app looked better.

### Please Sir can help!!
